        by setting up, writing code, and testing the project.

        - Created a superuser and users [See 0_USER.txt].  
        - Developed the entire Team Info section & the data (+JavaScript). 
        - Developed the entire News section & the data (+JavaScript).
        - Sorted all the data above by date (Team Info - Ascending, News - Descending).
        - Developed the entire Reaction & Comment function for the News section.
        - Improved the Reaction & Comment function by limiting 1 reaction per post per user, changing the reaction buttons' color if such reaction is being selected, 
	preventing automatic scroll-up to the top of the page after reacting or commenting, and adding the deleting-one's-own-comment button.
        - Added all the basic/necessary data to the project.
        - Solved image's caching problem.
        - Modified OnlineCourse/static/onlinecourse/course.css
